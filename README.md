# Lenslocked 

## Description

Lenslocked is a photo sharing platform made with Go on the backend and with Tailwind as our front-end. It uses Gooses with Docker for automatic creation of our database tables. We use mailtrap for the password backup process.

### How to use it  
First create and fill a  .env file. Copy the .env.template to know what fields  need to be filled.

After that, run docker-compose that will setup, our db,tailwind and adminer(a simple front-end to see the data stored on our database):
    
    docker compose up 

Open another terminal, while docker runs, and run our server with:

    go run cmd/server/server.go
